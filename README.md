Problem  definition:
In our country(Bangladesh) has no problem solving platform in bangle for students. So Students can not get proper help when they face any kind of academic problem .Many students can not describe their exact problem in English/another language after that their problem could not solved yet. I want to help this kind of Bangladeshi Students by the Bangladeshi experts in different sector.

 what’s the idea??
“Solve master” is an web/android app which solves Students any kind of        problem with “discuss and decision” method . In this app Students post their individuals problem for seeking the best solution . Experts solve this providing solution or links . It will have both bangle/ English Version based on users choice.

two kinds of user registration: 
1)Students (Bangladeshi university /college )
2)Experts /Teachers (A user can register as  students and expert if he thinks or believed with skill for any category).
Experts will be categorized by their providing skills . A student will be promoted expert if he solved 50 problems at a single category. There will be rating for experts and problem makers in account of their activities (Bangladeshi companies gets real skillful person) . If anyone’s problem related with some ones previously solved problems that’s will be shown in related problems menu . Bangla converter will be given (if any problem or solution is in English/…) so Bangla platform will be developed . A total user friendly timeline view will be given for comment/link  with problems with solution. One people will registered with Name , company Name/university/college name, Mobile number /Email/facebook . Confirmation will be send in email  or moble number user provide . one can mention a Expert for getting  solution this will be notified to him (expert) with facebook/email notification. After that a user friendly Bangladeshi problem solving platform(app) will be developed .Our students/users will get a complex problems solution with in a single moment . Motivator type post also given by  experts so a new user can put his goal for his own  life line .
